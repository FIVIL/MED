## Description

In computational linguistics and computer science, edit distance is a way of quantifying how dissimilar two strings (e.g., words) are to one another by counting the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into the other. Edit distances find applications in natural language processing, where automatic spelling correction can determine candidate corrections for a misspelled word by selecting words from a dictionary that have a low distance to the word in question. In bioinformatics, it can be used to quantify the similarity of DNA sequences, which can be viewed as strings of the letters A, C, G and T.[wikipedia]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance

## This Project

This project is a simple implementation of minimum edit distance using C# programming language and WPF for Introduction to Natural Languages processing course.
